forms are HTML and follow HTTP conventions
forms are the combination of a get and a post
in sinatra we mainly build forms manually (in HTML)
in rails we mainly use "form helpers" to dynamically create forms
it's only the HTML you write that matters
the most important things about a form are the name attributes of the inputs and the action of the form.
the action of the form tells you where the form will post.
